// Duplicated and missing number in an array
// The input nums is supposed to be an array of unique integers
//  ranging from 1 to nums.length (inclusive). However, there is a mistake: 
// one of the numbers in the array
// duplicated, which means another number is missing.
// Find and return the sum of the duplicated number and the missing number.
// Example in the array [4, 3, 3, 1], 3is present twice and 2 is missing, 
// so 3 +2= 5 should be returned.
