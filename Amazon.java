// Amazon Interview Experience: 

// First Round:
// 1. Given a Website , which is receiving a lot of clicks at any instant of time. You have to design a system that can give me:(Complexity required: O(1) time, O(1) Space)
//     1. No. of clicks in last minute
//     2. No. of clicks in last hour

//     3. No. of clicks in last day


// Second Round: 

// 1. Given a tree, convert all its leaf nodes to doubly Linked List
// 2. Write code to add/remove/search a node in the above tree, also maintain the Linked list behavior in it.
// 3. List the Complexities(insertion/Deletion/Search) of the tree after the above modification
// 4. Write the code for deletion of node In a BST
// 5. Complexity of the code , if same linked list behavior is required here too
// 6. Write code for solving the Snake and Ladder Problem
// 7. Discuss 3 ways to detect and remove a loop in a linked list

 


// Third Round:
// 1. Rotten Tomatoes(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum...)


// (2 Different approaches)
// 2. Long Discussion on Projects


// Fourth Round:
